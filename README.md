A Unity WebGL project featuring a 3D AI avatar that simulates pharmacy patient interactions with voice capabilities.

## Features ✨

- **3D AI Patient Avatar**: Lifelike virtual patient for pharmacy training scenarios
- **Voice Interaction**: Speech recognition and synthesis for natural conversations
- **WebGL Optimized**: Runs directly in browsers with microphone support
- **AI Integration**: Connects with AI services through the [Proxy API](https://github.com/jsproule899/AI-API-Proxy)
- **Pharmacy Scenario Simulation**: Demonstrates real-world pharmacy workflows

## WebGL Microphone Integration 🎤
This project requires special handling for microphone input in WebGL builds as Unity's built-in Microphone class doesn't work in WebGL builds. The bnco-dev solution is implemented in this project.
 **[unity-webgl-microphone](https://github.com/bnco-dev/unity-webgl-microphone)**  
   A free MIT-licensed package that provides WebGL microphone support matching Unity's standard Microphone class API. Key features:
   - Drop-in replacement for Unity's Microphone class
   - Handles browser permission workflows
   - Manages audio buffer streaming
   - MIT license allows commercial use

## 3D Avatar Library🙋🙋‍♂️🙋‍♀️
This project used 3D avatars generated by the ReadyPlayerMe 3D Avatar platform. Additional avatasrs may be generated and imported and added to the Avatars folder ensuring that the naming convention and properties are consistent with the existing avatars.
**[ReadyPlayerMe](https://docs.readyplayer.me/ready-player-me)**
